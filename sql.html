	<p>28.What is group by and it's aggregate functions ?<br>
	 It is used to group records with identical data and can be used in conjuction with some aggregate functions to produce summarized results from database. <br>
	 The GROUP BY statement is often used with aggregate functions (COUNT(), MAX(), MIN(), SUM(), AVG()) to group the result-set by one or more columns.
	 <ul>
		<li>
			<u>Count: </u> Returns the total number of rows in a table, and is usually used with the SELECT statement

			<u>Having: </u> i)It is used to filter records in combination with the group by clause <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    ii)It is different from where, since the where clause cannot filter aggregate records. 
		</li>

		</li> 
	 </ul>

	</li>
	 <li><u>In-Tangible:</u> <br>
	 It is an entity in DBMS, which is a non-physical object that we cannot see or touch. In simple words, an entity that does not have any physical existence in the real world is known as an intangible entity.

		</ul>
	</p>

	<p>32.What is join and its types ?<br>
	  It is used to combine records(rows) from 2 or more tables	in an sql database based on a related columns between two tables.
	  <ul>
		<li>
			<u>Inner Join: </u> It retrieves records that have matching values in both tables involved in the join that is widely used for join queries <br>
			<div class="box">
			 select city.id,city.countrycode,countrylanguage.countrycode,countrylanguage.language <br>
			 from city join countrylanguage <br>
			 on city.countrycode = countrylanguage.countrycode limit 10;
			</div> <br>
		</li>

		<li>
			<u>Left Join: </u> It retrieves all records from the left and the matched records from right. <br>
			<div class="box">
			 select city.id,city.countrycode,countrylanguage.countrycode,countrylanguage.language <br>
			 from city left join countrylanguage <br>
			 on city.countrycode = countrylanguage.countrycode limit 10; <br>
			</div> <br>
		</li>

		<li>

			 on city.countrycode = countrylanguage.countrycode limit 10; <br>
			</div> <br>
		</li>

		<li>
			<u>Full Join: </u> It retrieves all records where there is a match either the left or the right table. <br>
			<div class="box">
			 select city.id, city.countrycode, countrylanguage.countrycode, countrylanguage.language <br>

			 on city.countrycode = countrylanguage.countrycode limit 10; <br>
			</div> <br>
		</li>

		<li>
			<u>Self Join: </u> It is a case of regular join where a table is joined itself based on some relation between it's own column. <br>
			<div class="box">
			 select c1.id, c1.countrycode, c2.id AS parent_id, c2.countrycode AS parent_countrycode <br>
			 from city AS c1 <br>
			 inner join city AS c2 <br>
			 on c1.parent_id = c2.id <br>
			 limit 10;
			</div> <br>
		</li>

		<li>
			<u>Cross join: </u>i)It can be defined as an cartesian product of two tables involved in the join.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ii)It will combine each row from the first rowset with each row from the second rowset.
                                                            <div class="box">

                                                            from city <br>
                                                            cross join countrylanguage <br>
                                                            limit 10;

	</p>

	<p>33.What are the types of errors in sql ?<br>
	<ul>
		<li>
		 <u>Syntax error: </u>It occurs when sql statement do not follow the correct synatx and structure of the language.
		</li>

		<li>
		 <u>Semantic error: </u>It occurs when sql statment is grametically correct but does not produce desired results due to incorrect logic.
		</li>

		<li>
		 <u>Data type error: </u> It occurs when data is inserted in a way that does not match the expected data type
		</li>

		<li>
		 <u>Transaction error: </u> These occurs when a transaction fails due to problem with locking
		</li>

		<li>
		 <u>Constraint Validation: </u> It occurs when the sql validates one or more constraint on the database 
		</li>
	</ul>
