	<p> 1. What is Java? <br>
	 Java is an high-level,object oreinted platform independent programming language <br> 
	 It was developed by James Gosling in 1991 <br>
	 It can also known as platform as it provide it's own JRE & API</p>
	 
	 <p>2. What is Platform? <br>
	 A plaform is the hardware or software enviorment in which a piece of software is executed </p>
	 
	 <p>3. What is Java Virtual Machine(JVM)? <br>
	 JVM is a virtual machine that enables the computer to run the java program <br> 
	 JVM acts like a run-time engine which calls the main method present in java code <br>
	 Java code is compiled by JVM to a byte code which is machine independent and close to native code </p>
	 
	 <p>4.What is java Run-time enviorment(JRE)?<br>
	  It is a implementation of JVM and JRE is a set of software tool which are used for developing java applications </p>
	  
	 <p>5.What is Java Development Tool Kit(JDK)? <br>
	 It is a software development environment which is used to develop Java applications and applets</p>
	 
	 <p>6.What is Just in time Compiler(JIT)? <br>
	  It is used to improve the performance. JIT compiles parts of the bytecode that have similar functionality at the same time, and hence reduces the amount of time needed for           compilation.</p>	 

	 <p>7.What gives Java its 'write once and run anywhere' nature?? <br>
	  Java compiler converts the Java programs into the class file (Byte Code) which is the intermediate language between source code and machine code. This bytecode is not platform           specific and can be executed on any computer.</p>	 

	 <p>8.What is Object Cloning? <br>
	  It is an ability to recreate an object entirely similar to an existing object is known as object cloning</p>	 
	  
	 <p>9.What is Package? <br>
	  A package is a collection of related classes and interfaces providing access protection and namespace mangement</p>	 

	 <p>10.What is wrapper class? <br>
	  In java when you declare primitive data type, then wrapper classes are responsible for converting them to object</p>	 

	 <p>11.What is OOPS? <br>
	  OOPS is abbrevated as Object Oreinted Programming system in which programs are considered as a collection of objects. Each object is nothing but an instance of class </p>	 

	 <p>12.What is class? <br>
	  A class is simply a representation of a type of object. It is a blueprint/plan/template that describes the details of an object</p>	 

	 <p>13.What is object? <br>
	  An object is an instance of class. It has it's own state,behavior and identity</p>	 

	 <p>14.What is Encapsulation? <br>
	  It is defined as a wrapping of data in a single unit, it is more defined with setter and getter code. It is also known as the combination of data hiding and abstraction</p>	 

	 <p>15.What is abstraction? <br>
	  The process of hiding the innner details of an application from the outer world</p>	 

	 <p>16.What is inheritance? <br>
	  The mechanism where a new class is derived from existing class</p>	 

	 <p>17.What is Polymorphism? <br>
	  Polymorphism is nothing but assigning behavior or value in a subclass to something that was already declared in the main class.Simply, Polymorphism takes more than one form <br>
	  <ul>
		<li>
          <u>Compile-time Polymorphism:</u> It allows you to create more than one function with same name and different signature <br>
		</li>
	<li>
          <u>Run-time Polymorphism:</u> It allows you to create more than one function with same name and same signature</p>	       
                    </li>
	  </ul>

	 <p>18.What is method-overloading? <br>
	  It is the ability to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters in the same class</p>	 

	 <p>19.What is method-overriding? <br>
	  It is the ability to provide a different implementation of a method in a subclass that is already defined in it's superclass</p>	 

	 <p>20.What is method? <br>
	  A method in java is a block of code that performs a specific task</p>	 

	  <p>21.What is the difference between method overloading and method overriding? <br>
 	   Method overloading involves defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters in the same class, while method overriding involves providing a different implementation of a method in a subclass that is already defined in its superclass. </p>
                   
	 <p>22.What is local variable? <br>
	  A local variable can be anywhere inside a method or a specific block of code</p>	 

	 <p>23.What is Global Variable? <br>
	  A global variable can be declared outside the function and are accessible through out the program</p>	 

	 <p>24.What is object cloning? <br>
	  It is an ability to recreate an object entirely similar to an existing object known as object cloning</p>	 

	 <p>25.What is a constructor in Java? <br>
	  A constructor in Java is a special method that is used to initialize objects of a class. It is called automatically when an object is created and has the same name as the class. </p>	 

	 <p>26.What is the difference between a constructor and a method? <br>
	  A constructor is a special method used for object initialization and is called automatically when an object is created. A method, on the other hand, is a block of code that performs a specific task and needs to be called explicitly. </p>	 

	 <p>27.What is the "this" keyword in Java? <br>
	 The "this" keyword in Java refers to the current instance of a class. It can be used to access instance variables, call instance methods, or invoke constructors. </p>

	 <p>28.What is a static variable in Java? <br>
	 A static variable in Java is a variable that belongs to the class rather than an instance of the class. It is shared among all instances of the class. </p>

	 <p>29.What is the purpose of the "static" keyword in Java? <br>
	 The "static" keyword in Java is used to declare variables, methods, and nested classes that belong to the class itself, rather than instances of the class. It allows accessing them without creating an object of the class. </p>

	 <p>30.What is a thread in Java? <br>
	 A thread in Java is a lightweight unit of execution within a program. It allows concurrent execution of multiple tasks or activities, enabling better utilization of system resources. </p>

	 <p>31.How do you create and start a thread in Java? <br>
	 To create and start a thread in Java, you can either extend the "Thread" class and override the "run()" method, or implement the "Runnable" interface and pass it to a new "Thread" object. Then call the "start()" method on the thread object to begin execution. </p>

	 <p>32.What is the purpose of the "super" keyword in Java? <br>
	 The "super" keyword in Java is used to refer to the superclass of a class. It can be used to access superclass members, invoke superclass constructors, or differentiate between superclass and subclass members with the same name. </p>

	 <p>33.What is the difference between "==" and ".equals()" in Java? <br> 
	 The "==" operator in Java is used to compare the equality of object references, while the ".equals()" method is used to compare the equality of object values. The ".equals()" method can be overridden to provide custom equality comparison. </p>

	 <p>34.What is the purpose of the "final" keyword in method parameters? <br>
	 The "final" keyword in method parameters is used to make the parameter value unchangeable within the method. It ensures that the parameter cannot be reassigned or modified. </p>

	 <p>35.What is synchronization in Java? <br>
	 Synchronization in Java is a technique used to control the access and execution of multiple threads to ensure that only one thread can access a shared resource or code block at a time. </p>

	 <p>36.What is the difference between the "synchronized" block and the "synchronized" method? <br>
	 A "synchronized" block in Java allows a specific block of code to be synchronized, ensuring that only one thread can execute it at a time. A "synchronized" method applies synchronization to the entire method, making it mutually exclusive for all threads. </p>

	 <p>37.What is the difference between checked and unchecked exceptions? <br>
	 Checked exceptions are checked at compile-time, and the programmer is required to handle or declare them using the "throws" keyword. Unchecked exceptions, on the other hand, are not checked at compile-time, and the programmer is not obligated to handle or declare them. </p>

	 <p>38.What is the difference between checked exceptions and runtime exceptions? <br>
	 Checked exceptions are checked at compile-time and must be handled or declared, while runtime exceptions (unchecked exceptions) are not required to be handled or declared. </p>
                   
	 <p>39.What is an exception in Java? <br>
	 An exception in Java is an event that occurs during the execution of a program, which disrupts the normal flow of instructions. It represents an error condition or an exceptional circumstance. </p>

	 <p>40.How do you handle exceptions in Java? <br>
	 Exceptions in Java can be handled using try-catch blocks. The code that may throw an exception is placed inside the try block, and if an exception occurs, it is caught and handled in the catch block. </p>

	 <p>41.What is the purpose of the "try-catch-finally" block in Java? <br>
	 The "try-catch-finally" block in Java is used to handle exceptions. The "try" block contains the code that may throw an exception, the "catch" block catches and handles the exception, and the "finally" block contains cleanup code that is executed regardless of whether an exception occurs or not. </p>

	 <p>42.What is the purpose of the "finally" block in exception handling? <br>
	 The "finally" block in Java is used to define a block of code that will be executed regardless of whether an exception occurs or not. It is often used to release resources or perform cleanup operations. </p>

	 <p>43.What is the Java API? <br>
	 The Java API (Application Programming Interface) is a collection of classes, interfaces, and other resources provided by the Java Development Kit (JDK). It provides a set of predefined classes and methods for building Java applications. </p>

	 <p>44.What is functional programming in Java? <br>
	 Functional programming in Java is a programming paradigm that emphasizes writing programs using pure functions and immutable data. It involves treating functions as first-class citizens and utilizing higher-order functions and lambda expressions. </p>

	 <p>45.What are the Java 8 features for functional programming? <br>
	 Java 8 introduced several features to support functional programming, including lambda expressions, functional interfaces, the Stream API for working with collections, and default methods in interfaces. </p>

	 <p>46.What is a lambda expression in Java? <br>
	 A lambda expression in Java is an anonymous function that can be used to simplify the syntax of functional interfaces. It allows for more concise and readable code, especially when working with functional programming constructs. </p>

	 <p>47.What is the purpose of the "Math" class in Java? <br>
	 The "Math" class in Java provides various methods for performing common mathematical operations, such as square roots, trigonometric functions, exponential calculations, rounding, and more. </p>

	 <p>48.What is the purpose of the "Math.random()" method in Java? <br>
	 The "Math.random()" method in Java returns a random double value between 0.0 (inclusive) and 1.0 (exclusive). It is often used to generate random numbers or simulate random behavior. </p>

	 <p>49.What is the purpose of the "FileNotFoundException" in Java? <br>
	 The "FileNotFoundException" in Java is an exception that is thrown when an attempt to access a file that does not exist or cannot be found is made. It is typically caught and handled to handle file-related errors. </p>

	 <p>50.What is the purpose of the "NullPointerException" in Java? <br>
	 The "NullPointerException" in Java is an exception that is thrown when a null reference is accessed and used where an object reference is expected. It indicates a programming error and should be handled or prevented to avoid unexpected crashes. </p>

	 <p>51.What is the purpose of the "ArithmeticException" in Java? <br>
	 The "ArithmeticException" in Java is an exception that is thrown when an arithmetic operation produces an illegal or undefined result. It typically occurs when dividing by zero or performing unsupported mathematical operations. </p>

	 <p>52.What is the purpose of the "NumberFormatException" in Java? <br>
	 The "NumberFormatException" in Java is an exception that is thrown when a string cannot be parsed into a numeric value of the expected format. It occurs when attempting to convert a string to an integer, float, or double, but the string does not represent a valid number. </p>

	 <p>53.What is the purpose of the "ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException" in Java? <br>
	 The "ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException" in Java is an exception that is thrown when an invalid index is used to access an array. It indicates that the index is either negative or exceeds the array's bounds. </p>

	 <p>54.What is the purpose of the "Comparator" interface in Java? <br>
	 The "Comparator" interface in Java is used to define custom ordering of objects. It provides a way to compare objects based on specific criteria other than their natural ordering defined by the "Comparable" interface. </p>

	 <p>55.What is the purpose of the "Comparable" interface in Java? <br>
	 The "Comparable" interface in Java is used to define the natural ordering of objects of a class. It provides a method, "compareTo()", that allows objects to be compared and sorted based on their natural order. </p>

	 <p>56.What is the difference between the "Comparable" and "Comparator" interfaces? <br>
	 The "Comparable" interface is used to define a natural ordering for a class by implementing the "compareTo()" method. The "Comparator" interface, on the other hand, provides a way to define custom ordering by implementing the "compare()" method and is independent of the class being compared. </p>

	 <p>57.What is the purpose of the "throw" keyword in Java? <br>
	 The "throw" keyword in Java is used to manually throw an exception. It is typically used when a program encounters an error or exceptional situation that cannot be handled, and the control should be transferred to an exception handler. </p>

	 <p>58.What is the purpose of the "throws" keyword in Java? <br>
	 The "throws" keyword in Java is used in method declarations to specify that a method may throw certain types of exceptions. It allows the caller of the method to handle the exception or propagate it further. </p>

	 <p>59.What is the difference between the "throw" and "throws" keywords in Java? <br>
	 The "throw" keyword in Java is used to manually throw an exception, while the "throws" keyword is used in method declarations to specify that the method may throw certain types of exceptions. </p>
