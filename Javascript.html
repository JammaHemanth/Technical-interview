	                 <p>1.What is Javascipt <br>
                       JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used for adding interactivity to web pages.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>2.What are the data types in Javascipt <br>
                       JavaScript has six primitive data types: string, number, boolean, null, undefined, and symbol, along with a complex data type called object.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>3.What are the differences between Java and JavaScript? <br>
                     JavaScript is a client-side scripting language and Java is object Oriented Programming language. Both of them are totally different from each other.
                     <ul>
                        <li>
                           <u>JavaScript: </u> It is a light-weighted programming language (“scripting language”) for developing interactive web pages. It can insert dynamic text into the HTML elements. JavaScript is also known as the browser’s language. <br>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <u>Java: </u>Java is one of the most popular programming languages. It is an object-oriented programming language and has a virtual machine platform that allows you to create compiled programs that run on nearly every platform. Java promised, “Write Once, Run Anywhere”.
                        </li>
                       </ul>
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>4.Which symbol is used for comments in JavaScript?<br>
                     Comments prevent the execution of statements. Comments are ignored while the compiler executes the code. There are two type of symbols to represent comments in JavaScript:
                     <ul>
                        <li>
                           <u>Double slash: </u> "// comment" It is known as a single-line comment.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <u>single slash: </u> "/* Multi-line comment */" It is known as a multi-line comment.
                        </li>
                     </ul>
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>5.What is the difference between null and undefined?<br>
                      null represents the intentional absence of any object value, while undefined indicates the absence of a value or an uninitialized variable.
                    </p>
                                         
                    <p>6.What is the difference between == and === in JavaScript? <br>
                     The == operator checks for equality after performing type coercion, while the === operator checks for equality without type coercion, ensuring both the value and type match.
                    </p>

                    <p>7.What would be the result of 3+2+”7″?<br>
                     Here, 3 and 2 behave like an integer, and “7” behaves like a string. So 3 plus 2 will be 5. Then the output will be 5+”7″ = 57. 
                    </p>

                    <p>8.What is the use of the isNaN function?<br>
                     The number isNan function determines whether the passed value is NaN (Not a number) and is of the type “Number”. In JavaScript, the value NaN is considered a type of number. It returns true if the argument is not a number, else it returns false.
                    </p>

                    <p>9.What do you mean by NULL in JavaScript?<br>
                     The NULL value represents that no value or no object. It is known as empty value/object.
                    </p>

                    <p>10.What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState?<br>
                       <ul>
                        <li>
                           <u>ViewState:</u> It is specific to a single page in a session.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <u>Sessionstate:</u> It is user specific that can access all the data on the web pages.
                        </li>
                       </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p>11.What are all the looping structures in JavaScript ?<br>
                       <ul>
                        <li>
                           <u>While loop :</u> A while loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given Boolean condition. The while loop can be thought of as a repeating if statement.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <u>for loop :</u> A for loop provides a concise way of writing the loop structure. Unlike a while loop, for statement consumes the initialization, condition and increment/decrement in one line thereby providing a shorter, easy to debug structure of looping.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <u>Do while :</u> A do-while loop is similar to while loop with the only difference that it checks the condition after executing the statements, and therefore is an example of Exit Control Loop.
                        </li>
                       </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p>12.What is the difference between an alert box and a confirmation box?<br>
                     An alert box will display only one button which is the OK button. It is used to inform the user about the agreement has to agree. But a Confirmation box displays two buttons OK and cancel, where the user can decide to agree or not.
                    </p>

                    <p>13.How to get the status of a CheckBox?<br>
                     The DOM Input Checkbox Property is used to set or return the checked status of a checkbox field. This property is used to reflect the HTML Checked attribute.If the CheckBox is checked then it returns True.
                     <br/><p>document.getElementById("GFG").checked;</p>
                    </p>

                    <p>14.What is the difference between call() and apply() methods ?<br>
                     Both methods are used in a different situation
                     <ul>
                        <li>
                           <u>call() Method:</u> It calls the method, taking the owner object as argument. The keyword this refers to the ‘owner’ of the function or the object it belongs to. We can call a method that can be used on different objects.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <u>apply() Method:</u> The apply() method is used to write methods, which can be used on different objects. It is different from the function call() because it takes arguments as an array.
                        </li>
                     </ul>
                     </p>

                     <p>15. What is the difference between innerHTML & innerText? <br>
                        The innerText property sets or returns the text content as plain text of the specified node, and all its descendants whereas the innerHTML property sets or returns the plain text or HTML contents in the elements. Unlike innerText, inner HTML lets you work with HTML rich text and doesn’t automatically encode and decode text.
                     </p>

                     <p>16. Write the errors shown in JavaScript?<br>

                           </li>
                           <li>
                              <u>Logical error:</u>  It is the most difficult error to be traced as it is the error on the logical part of the coding or logical error is a bug in a program that causes to operate incorrectly and terminate abnormally.
                           </li>
                           <li>
                              <u>Runtime error:</u> A runtime error is an error that occurs during the running of the program, also known as an exception.
                           </li>
                        </ul>
                      </p>

                     <p>17.What does var myArray = [[]]; statement declares? <br>
                        In JavaScript, this statement is used to declare a two-dimensional array.
