                        The super() function in Python is used to call a method in a superclass or parent class. It isoften used in method overriding to invoke the superclass's implementation of the method before adding additional functionality in the subclass.
                    </p>

                    <p> 54. What is the purpose of the __getitem__ method in Python? <br>
                        The __getitem__ method in Python is a special method that allows objects to define behavior for indexing and slicing operations. It is called when an item is accessed using square brackets ([]) and supports accessing items by index or slicing.
                    </p>

                    <p> 55. What is the purpose of the __setitem__ method in Python? <br>
                        The __setitem__ method in Python is a special method that allows objects to define behavior for assigning values to items using square brackets ([]). It is called when an item is assigned a value using indexing.
                    </p>

                    <p> 56. What is the purpose of the __len__ method in Python? <br>
                        The __len__ method in Python is a special method that returns the length of an object. It is called when the len() function is used on an object.
                    </p>

                    <p> 57. What is the purpose of the __iter__ method in Python? <br>
                        The __iter__ method in Python is a special method that returns an iterator object. It is used to make an object iterable, meaning it can be looped over using a for loop or used with other iterator-related functions and constructs.
                    </p>

                    <p> 58. What is the purpose of the __next__ method in Python? <br>
                        The __next__ method in Python is a special method that returns the next item in an iterator. It is called by the next() function and is used in conjunction with the __iter__ method to create custom iterators.
                    </p>

                    <p> 59. What is object-oriented programming (OOP)? <br>
                        Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects, which are instances of classes. It emphasizes encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
                    </p>

                    <p> 60. What are Python classes and objects? <br>
                        In Python, a class is a blueprint that defines the properties and behaviors of objects. An object is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity and can interact with other objects.
                    </p>

                    <p> 61. How do you create an object in Python? <br>
                        An object is created by calling the class as if it were a function. The class acts as a constructor, initializing the object and returning it.
                    </p>

                    <p> 62. What is inheritance in Python? <br>
                        Inheritance is a mechanism in Python that allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class. It enables code reuse and supports the creation of hierarchical class structures.
                    </p>

                    <p> 63. What is polymorphism in Python? <br>
                        Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on multiple forms or have multiple behaviors. In Python, polymorphism is achieved through method overriding and method overloading (using default argument values or variable-length arguments).
                    </p>

                    <p> 64. What is encapsulation in Python? <br>
                        Encapsulation is the process of bundling data and methods together within a class. It allows for data hiding and controlling access to the object's attributes using getter and setter methods.
                    </p>

                    <p> 65. What is method overriding? <br>
                        Method overriding is the process of defining a method in a subclass that has the same name as a method in its superclass. The subclass method overrides the implementation of the superclass method.
                    </p>

                    <p> 66. What is method overloading? <br>
                        Method overloading is not directly supported in Python. However, you can achieve similar functionality by defining a single method with default argument values or using variable-length arguments.
                    </p>

                    <p> 67. What is the purpose of the zip() function in Python? <br>
                        The zip() function in Python is used to combine multiple iterables (such as lists or tuples) into a single iterable of tuples. It pairs up corresponding elements from each iterable, stopping when the shortest iterable is exhausted.
                    </p>

                    <p> 68. What is a metaclass in Python? <br>
                        A metaclass in Python is a class that defines the behavior and structure of other classes. It allows you to customize class creation, modify attributes, and add additional functionality to classes.
