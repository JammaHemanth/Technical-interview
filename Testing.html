<p>
	<p> 1. What is Software Testing? <br>
	 It is a Validation Process that confirms that system works as per the business requirement </p> 
	 
	 <p>2. What is a test case? <br>
	 It is a document that has set of conditions or actions in order to verify the expected functionality of the feature</p>

	 It gives an idea of what we have to test and it is like high level test case</p> 
	 
	 <p>4. What is test plan? <br>
	 It stores all possible testing activites to ensure a quality product <br>
	 It gather data from the product description,requirements and use case documents </p>
	 
	 <p>5. What is Functional testing? <br>
	 It is a testing technique which checks the functionality of an application works under the required specification
	 
	 <p>6. What is Non-Functional Testing? <br>
	 It checks all the non-functional aspects such as perfomance,usability and reliability etc </p>
	 
	 <p>7. What is Sanity Testing? <br>
	 It is a sub-set of regression testing and testing is done at the release level to test the main functionalities of an application </p>

	 It is a testing method that is used to determine if a new software build is ready for the next testing phase </p>
	 
	 <p>9. What is Regression Testing? <br>
	 it is a process of software testing that checks the code does not effect the current features of an application </p>
	 
	 <p>10. What is Accessibility Testing? <br>
	 It is used to verify whether a software product is accessible to the people having disabilities (deaf,blind etc)</p>
	 
	 <p>11. What is Re-testing? <br>
	 It is a process of testing that checks the test case which were failed in the final execution </p>
	 
	 <p>12. What is Alpha-testing? <br>
	 It is type of user acceptance testing conducted in the software company by the test engineers just before
                     delivering the application to the client. </p>

	<p>13. What is Beta-testing? <br>
	 It is also a type of user acceptance testing conducted in the clientâ€™s place either by the end users or third
                     party experts, just before actual implementation of the application.
	</p>

	<p>14. What is Usability testing? <br>
	 It is a type of testing in which one will test the user friendliness of the application
	</p>
	 
	 <p>15. What is Performance testing? <br>
	 Performance testing is a technique that evaluates the speed, scalability, and stability of an application under a given workload. It helps ensure the quality of the software and makes the application ready to be released into the market.
	</p>

	<p>16. What is Storage testing? <br>
	 The execution of application under huge amounts of resources to estimate storage limitations is called storage Testing.
	</p>
	 
	<p>17. What is security testing? <br>
	 It is a process to determine whether the system protects data and maintain functionality as intended
	</p>
	 	 
	<p>18. What is Random/Moneky testing? <br>
	 Random testing is also known as monkey testing. is nothing but testing the Application Randomly without following any specific Application Flow.
	</p>

	<p>19. What is Acceptance testing? <br>
	 It is a type of testing done by a possible end-user or customer to see if the software meets the business requirement
	</p>
	 	 	 
	<p>20. What is Boundary Vale Analysis? <br>
	 It is a software testing technique in which tests are designed to include representatives of boundary values in a range
	</p>
	 	 
	<p>21. What is Positive testing? <br>
	 It is a testing process that when you give a valid input and except some actions that are completed according to the specification is known as positive testing
	</p>

	<p>22.What is Negative testing? <br>
	  It is a testing process that when you give an invalid input and recieve an error known as negative testing
	</p>	 
	 	 
	<p>23.What is Globalization testing? <br>
	  It is the process of designing a software apllication so that it can be adapted to various language and regions without any changes
	</p>

	<p>24.What is Localization testing? <br>
	  It is the process of adapting globalization software for a specific region or language by adding local specific components
	</p>	 

	<p>25.What is security testing? <br>
	  It is a process to determine whether the system protects data and maintains faunctionality as intended
	</p>	 

	<p>26.What is integration testing? <br>
	 Integration Testing is nothing but testing the interface between different components or modules.
	</p>	 

	<p>27.What is Reliability testing? <br>
	  It tests the functionality of an application continuosly for a particular period of time
	</p>	 

	<p>28.What is Recovery testing? <br>
	  It tests the application to check how well it recovers from crashes or disasters
	</p>	  	 

	<p>29.What is Verifcation and Validation? <br>
	  I) It is the process of confirming that it meets the users requirement <br>
	  II) It is the process of confirming that software meets it's specification done through specification
	</p>	 
	  	 
	<p>30. What is Black-box testing? <br>
	 The strategy of black box testing is based on requirements and specification. It requires no need of knowledge of internal path, structure or implementation of the software being tested
	</p>
	 
	<p>31. What is White-box testing? <br>
	 White box testing is based on internal paths, code structure, and implementation of the software being tested. It requires a full and detail programming skill
	</p>

	<p> 32. What is GUI Testing? <br>
	 GUI( <u>Graphical User Interface</u> ) Testing is nothing but testing the product or application that uses Graphical User Interface,to ensure that it meets the customer requirement.	
	</p>
	 
	<p> 33. What is the difference between Load and Stress Testing? <br>
                     I) In <u>Load testing</u> we are testing the software at its maximum limit. The basic purpose of Load testing to find out how many maximum user applications can handle without losing the performance. <br>
                     II) In <u>Stress Testing</u> we are testing the software beyond its limit to check the behavior of application when it crosses the maximum limit of user. 
	</p>

	<p>34.What is Agile testing? <br>
	 The Software Testing process contains several testing procedures and techniques that simplify the testing process and increase its efficiency.
	</p>
                   
	<p>35.What is Application Binary Interface (ABI)? <br>
	 A specification defining requirements for portability of applications in binary forms across different system platforms and environments.
	</p>
                   
	<p>36.What is Application Programming Interface (API)? <br>
	 A formalized set of software calls and routines that can be referenced by an application program in order to access supporting system or network services.
	</p>
                   
	<p>37.What is Automated Software Quality (ASQ)? <br>
	 The use of software tools, such as automated testing tools, to improve software quality.
	</p>
                   
	<p>38.What is Binary Portability Testing? <br>
